## Overview

This project was pure fun for me, I was able to learn quite a lot from it. Also, I decided to build this it using Angular since I'm currently on my way to learning it. It was a great way for me to recap what I've learned so far and also try new things if it comes to Angular Forms. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page
